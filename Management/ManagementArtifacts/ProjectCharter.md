## Project Overview

### Project Overview

The project aims to develop a "Tinder-style" recruitment application called "Adopt a Candidate". This application will revolutionize the traditional recruitment process by prioritizing soft skills, anonymizing candidates and companies to avoid discrimination, and emphasizing the human aspect of recruitment. The application will facilitate the connection between job seekers and companies, allowing them to find ideal matches based on skills and preferences.

## Project Objective

This project aims to develop a recruitment application that will:

- Develop a user-friendly application accessible on phones, tablets, and computers.
- Implement anonymization features for both candidates and companies to ensure fair recruitment practices.
- Emphasize soft skills over traditional qualifications and experience.
- Create a matching algorithm that connects candidates and companies based on their preferences and cultural fit.
- Facilitate communication and interaction between candidates and companies through the application.
