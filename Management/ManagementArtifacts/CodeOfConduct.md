## Introduction

This document serves as a code of conduct for Team3. It outlines the expected behavior, responsibilities, and guidelines for all team members to ensure a positive and productive working environment. By adhering to this code of conduct, team members can foster collaboration, respect, and professionalism throughout the project.

## Required Behavior

### Respect

All team members must treat each other with respect, kindness, and consideration. This includes valuing each other's opinions, listening actively, and maintaining a positive attitude towards one another.

### Communication

Effective communication is essential for successful collaboration. Team members must communicate openly, honestly, and transparently. This includes sharing updates, progress, challenges, and feedback in a timely manner.

## Prohibited Behavior

### Discrimination

Discrimination of any form, including racism, sexism, ageism, or any other form of prejudice, is strictly prohibited. Team members must treat each other with equality, fairness, and respect regardless of their background, identity, or beliefs.

### Harassment

Harassment, bullying, or any form of intimidation is unacceptable. Team members must create a safe and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable expressing themselves and contributing to the project.

## Abseentism and Punctuality

If a team member is unable to come in project time, they must inform the project manager in advance. If a team member is late, they must inform the project manager as soon as possible. If not informed, the project manager will take necessary actions such as giving a warning if it happens frequently.

## Warning System

If a team member violates the code of conduct, the following warning system will be implemented:

- **First Warning**: The team member will receive a verbal warning from the project manager.
- **Second Warning**: The team member will receive a written warning from the project manager.
- **Third Warning**: The project manager will send a message to Franck JEANNIN, to plan a meeting with the team member to speak about the situation.
