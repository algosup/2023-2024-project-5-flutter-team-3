# Management Artifacts Team 3

## What is the Management Artifacts document?

The Management Artifacts document is a collection of essential documents that outline the management processes, procedures, and guidelines for Team 3. These artifacts provide a framework for managing the project effectively, ensuring clear communication, accountability, and alignment among team members.

## Project Charter

The Project Charter outlines the project's objectives, scope, deliverables, and key stakeholders. It serves as a roadmap for the project, guiding the team in achieving its goals and delivering value to stakeholders.

You can find the Project Charter [here](ManagementArtifacts/ProjectCharter.md).

## Kpis

The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) document defines the metrics and targets that Team 3 will use to measure the project's success. These KPIs help track progress, identify areas for improvement, and ensure alignment with project goals.
