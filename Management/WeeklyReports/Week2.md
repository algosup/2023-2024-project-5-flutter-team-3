## Week 2 Issues and Remarques

Thanks to a google form that I will send to the team at the end of every week, I will be able to gather all the issues and remarques that the team faced during the week. This will help me to improve the project management and the team's productivity.

### Issues

- Issue to connect the database to the project at the beginning of the week. The issue was solved by the end of the week.

### Remarques

-  Maxime helped Thibaud to implement the login and register functionalities in the project. But instead of explaining how to do it, he did it himself. This is not a good practice because it doesn't help Thibaud to learn how to do it. Next time, Maxime should explain how to do it instead of doing it himself. But it's good that he helped Thibaud to solve the issue.



## Week 2 Objectives for Next Week

- Finish the Technical Specification Document
- Continue working on the code of the project
- Start working on the User Manual Document
- Create the test cases for the project

## Week 2 Conclusion

The week was very productive. The team was able to finish the Functional Specification Document, the Test Plan Document, and the database implementation. The team also started working on the Technical Specification Document and the code of the project. The issue that the team faced at the beginning of the week was solved by the end of the week. The team is ready to start the next week with new objectives and new challenges.
