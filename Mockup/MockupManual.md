## Swipe Page

One of our product's key features is to help job seekers and employers find companies that match the individual's skills and the job requirements. To achieve this, we use a Tinder-style card interface that briefly describes the job seeker's skills or the employer's requirement. Users have two options:

- Swipe left to express interest in the profile. If the other party also expresses interest, both users will be connected and can arrange an interview.
- Swipe right to indicate disinterest in the profile, which will no longer be recommended.

## Chat Box

The Chat box is the place where both the companies' representative and the job seeker will be able to communicate. After a match, the chat box will be available to the company only in the first place, they are the one that will be responsible for starting the conversation. The job seeker will only be able to answer to the company's message, once he received it.

### Company

When matching, the company has the choice to start messaging right away, or to wait to take a decision on whether or not they want to start communicating with the candidate right away. \
The company will be able to see the job seeker's profile and the job offer that the job seeker has applied to. The company will also be able to see the job seeker's preferences and skills.

The chat box will be organized by job offer. The company will be able to see all the matches they have got for a specific job offer, to improve readability and organization.

### Job Seeker

Upon receiving a message from a company, it is now the job seeker's turn to decide whether they want to keep the communication going or not. The job seeker will have the possibility to see the company's profile.
