## Project Description

For the final project of the 2023-2024 school year, we are working for a company named **[We Are Evolution](https://www.we-are-evolution.com)**, which is an employer branding agency. The goal of this project is to create a mobile/computer application, in Flutter, that will directly links the job seekers with the companies, in a Tinder-like way. The application will be named **Adopte un candidat** or **Adopt a candidate** in English.

- **User Registration**: The user can register with an email address and a password. üìù
- **Swapping System**: The user can swipe right or left to like or dislike a candidate / a company. üëçüëé
  - Everything is anonymous to avoid any discrimination. üé≠
- **Matching System**: If two users like each other, they will be matched.ü§ù
- **Chat System**: Once matched, the users can chat with each other. üí¨
